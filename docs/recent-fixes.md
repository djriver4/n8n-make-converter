## Expression Evaluator Fixes (March 2023)

### String Concatenation Fix

**Issue:** The expression evaluator was incorrectly handling string concatenation expressions (e.g., `={{ "https://example.com/api/" + $json.id }}`), resulting in `NaN` values instead of properly concatenated strings.

**Fix:** Implemented a robust approach to string concatenation that:
1. Properly identifies expressions containing the `+` operator and string literals
2. Correctly replaces variable references with their values from the context
3. Uses a safe evaluation approach with proper error handling
4. Preserves whitespace correctly in concatenated strings
5. Provides fallback mechanisms for complex scenarios

**Impact:** This fix enables reliable conversion of workflows that use string concatenation expressions, particularly URLs, message templates, and other dynamic content.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Before fix:
evaluateExpression('={{ "https://example.com/api/" + $json.id }}', context);
// Result: NaN

// After fix:
evaluateExpression('={{ "https://example.com/api/" + $json.id }}', context);
// Result: "https://example.com/api/12345"
```

**Implementation:**
The fix introduces a specialized handler for string concatenation expressions that:
- Detects string concatenation patterns
- Uses JSON.stringify for proper handling of variable values
- Creates a safe evaluation function
- Provides a fallback approach for complex expressions

**Test Coverage:**
Added comprehensive test cases for:
- Basic string concatenation
- Multiple concatenations
- Mixed data types
- Whitespace preservation

### Expression Evaluation Improvements

**Enhancement:** Improved the default expression evaluator to handle a wider range of expressions:
- Better detection of expression types
- More robust handling of variable references
- Enhanced error logging
- Improved fallback mechanisms

**Impact:** These improvements increase the reliability of expression evaluation throughout the conversion process, resulting in more accurate workflow conversions.

## Workflow Converter Enhancements

### Null Safety Improvements

**Issue:** Some parts of the workflow converter were not properly handling null or undefined values, leading to potential runtime errors.

**Fix:** Added proper null checks and optional chaining throughout the codebase to ensure safe handling of potentially missing data.

**Impact:** The workflow converter is now more robust when handling incomplete or malformed workflow definitions, resulting in fewer runtime errors and more graceful degradation.

### Type Safety Enhancements

**Issue:** Some TypeScript type definitions were not accurately reflecting the actual structure of data, leading to potential type errors.

**Fix:** Improved type definitions and interfaces to more accurately represent the data structures used in the system.

**Impact:** Improved type safety helps catch potential issues at compile time rather than runtime, leading to a more stable and maintainable codebase.

## Migration Notes

If you're using the Expression Evaluator directly, be aware that the behavior of string concatenation has changed. If you were applying your own workarounds for the previous behavior, you may need to update your code to accommodate the new implementation.

The fix is backward compatible with existing code that doesn't rely on the specific behavior of the broken implementation.
